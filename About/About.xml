  <description>This mod adds to RimWorld:
----------------
1 Door mat (rotate to align correctly with doorway) (no functionality beyond being pretty)
7 Circle rugs (1x1 to 7x7 tiles)
7 Square rugs (1x1 to 7x7 tiles)
6 Hall runners (1x2 to 1x7 tiles)
9 Rectangle rugs (2x3 to 6x8 tiles)

----------------

Credit:
All graphics and some XML coding by AElflaed (Fisty), extra XML coding and testing by Darc Clan.  All C# and some XML by LWM.

Permissions:
Based off the B19 version (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=934235098) by Fisty and Darc.
This page: https://www.nexusmods.com/rimworld/mods/112/? seems to grant permission to modify the mod?  If I am in any error, please forgive, and I will remove this version.  (I have tagged this version [LWM] so "Area Rugs 1.0" is still available)
